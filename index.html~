<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>
Heru Setiawan is an Indonesian and a passionate Introvert. He tells stories through drawings (and he apparently loves it). His rough yet softly painted brushes with cozy and calm colors distinguish the look of his works. After graduating bachelor visual communication design degree from ITS Surabaya, Heru spends most of his time resting and making illustrations for children books, animations, and for himself along with a small team of friends.
