I"<p>Written by Arleen Amidjaja, this little adventure anthology tells a story of twins Ben &amp; July and their love of being, making, meeting, or finding the most <em>“something”</em> in the whole world. The book encourages children to try and make new things, and to explore new places. Because the adventurous and playful nature of the book, I tried to give the characters a more stylized look, with fun gestures and expression.</p>

<p>The stories are mostly fun and quirky, suitable for the exaggerated and simplified look but at times they feel wonderful and beautiful.</p>

<p>I illustrated the book around 2020 but the book just got published in mid-2022. It was one of the very first illustration projects that I did for a bigger publisher and I learned a lot in the process that took almost a year to draw 200 pages of it.
I’m so grateful to have been through this and to have the book finished.</p>
