<p>The inspiration behind this was Neutral Milk Hotelâ€™s song, also one of my favorite songs from them,  The King of Carrot Flowers pt.1, written by Jeff Mangum. This, in my opinion, has some little hints of Jeff Mangumâ€™s obsession to Anne Frank which I found interesting. I depicted him as a young boy playing king with the ghost of Anne.</p>
