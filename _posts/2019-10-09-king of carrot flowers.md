The inspiration behind this was Neutral Milk Hotel's song, also my favorite of them,  The King of Carrot Flowers pt.1, written by Jeff Mangum. Here, in my opinion, was the most obvious sign of Jeff Mangum's obsession to Anne Frank which I found interesting. I depicted as a young boy playing king with the ghost of Anne.
