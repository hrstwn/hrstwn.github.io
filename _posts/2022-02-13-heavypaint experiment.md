It's been months since I purchased Heavypaint and so far I've only finished 3 drawings (I know, impressive, really).

On a serious note, though, despite the very minimum number of drawings that I've made with it, I still think that it's a tool that 'works' for me. I've tried many drawing apps my whole life, and this thing that I don't even know if you can adjust the HSV of a layer here, has already booked a special place in my heart. I don't know if it's just me being pretentious or what they say in their website is true (or maybe both) but I guess I have achieved the fun of "learning through limitation".

Heavypaint is an fun little drawing app developed by Vaughan Ling. It's super simple and 'different' in terms of the conventional ways of doing stuff like in other softwares (at least compared to the ones that I've tried).

But being different is not a weak point of this app. It *needs* to be different. It's an app where you draw just to draw. Not to impress your client or anything, (but if you're x_train that wouldn't be a hard thing to do). Heavypaint gives you a set of tools that works almost similarly to each other, but grouped into several presets that makes it easy for you to differentiate them. 

Anyway enough mumbling. Here, look at my ugly drawings I did with it. I don't really care what you think about them because again, Heavypaint is an app that I use just to draw, not to impress you. Maybe I'll talk about this app in detail in another chance, but no promises, though. *Cheers!*
