Written by Arleen Amidjaja, this little adventure anthology tells the story of twins Ben & July and their love of being, making, meeting, or finding the most “something” in the whole world. The book encourages children to try and make new things and explore new places. Because of the adventurous and playful nature of the book, I tried to give the characters a more stylized look, with fun gestures and expressions.

The stories are mostly fun and quirky, suitable for the exaggerated and simplified look but at times they feel wonderful and beautiful.

I illustrated the book around 2020 but the book just got published in mid-2022. It was one of the very first illustration projects that I did for a bigger publisher and I learned a lot in the process that took almost a year to draw 200 pages of it.

I’m so grateful to have been through this and to have the book finished.
